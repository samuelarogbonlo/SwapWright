## The Problem

DeFi has a $200B UX crisis. Last month, $500M+ in positions were liquidated after market volatility - not because traders didn't know what to do, but because traditional DEX interfaces are too slow and complicated to react in time.

SwapWright fixes this with conversational AI that both humans and autonomous agents can use.
