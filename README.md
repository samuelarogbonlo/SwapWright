# SwapWright

**ChatGPT for DeFi swaps** - Just say what you want to trade in plain English.

🎥 **[Watch Demo](https://www.loom.com/share/d31f559256ba4420a1bee456a27ab047?sid=c66feb17-21c5-4d51-a2b8-91f2df49becb)** | 🚀 **[Try It Live](https://swapwright.vercel.app)**

## What It Does

SwapWright makes DeFi token swaps as easy as texting. No complex interfaces, no confusing parameters. Just natural language.

**Example:**
```
You: "Swap 0.1 ETH for USDC"
SwapWright: [Fetches quote] → [Explains everything] → [Simulates] → [Executes]
```

## Key Features

- 🗣️ **Natural Language** - Chat interface powered by Claude AI
- 🤖 **AI Copilot** - Explains quotes, gas costs, risks in plain English
- 🔒 **Transaction Simulation** - Tenderly pre-execution validation
- ⚡ **Best Prices** - Uniswap v3 routing on Base
- 🔗 **Agent Communication Protocol** - Built for AI-to-AI integration
- 📊 **Portfolio Watchdog** - Real-time Aave health monitoring

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 14, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Web3**: Viem, Wagmi, RainbowKit
- **AI**: Claude 3.5 Sonnet (Anthropic)
- **DEX Integration**: Uniswap v3 (Quoter + SwapRouter02)
- **Security**: Tenderly Simulation
- **Network**: Base Mainnet

## The Problem

DeFi has a $200B UX crisis. Last month, $500M+ in positions were liquidated after market volatility - not because traders didn't know what to do, but because traditional DEX interfaces are too slow and complicated to react in time.

SwapWright fixes this with conversational AI that both humans and autonomous agents can use.

## 🤝 Virtuals ACP Integration

### Ecosystem Value
SwapWright is the **first DeFi swap primitive** for Virtuals Agent Commerce Protocol:

**For Virtuals Agents:**
- Reliable swap execution API for any trading/portfolio agent
- Risk assessment before execution
- Market context intelligence

**For Virtuals Ecosystem:**
- Attracts DeFi-focused agents to the network
- Enables multi-service compositions (swap + lend + stake)
- Transaction volume and fees for the protocol

### Agent Use Cases
1. **Portfolio Managers** - Rebalance positions across protocols
2. **Trading Bots** - Execute strategies with simulation safety
3. **DeFi Assistants** - Help users optimize yields

### Integration Stats
- Entity ID: `1bmholb3f5spq3pxn1naedr`
- API Endpoints: 3 (metadata, status, execute)
- Response Time: <500ms average
- Rate Limit: 10 req/min per agent
